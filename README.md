# amazon-reviews-analysis
The Amazon Reviews Analysis project focuses on understanding customer opinions through natural language processing (NLP) and visualizations. By analyzing product reviews, we uncover key patterns in sentiment, rating distribution, and recommendation behavior, providing valuable insights for sellers and product managers.

# Dataset
Source: Amazon Reviews Dataset

Records: 50,000+ customer reviews

Key Columns:

reviews.rating – Star rating (1–5)
reviews.text – Full review text
reviews.title – Review title
reviews.doRecommend – True/False
brand, category, price

# Tools & Technologies Used
Python	Core programming
Pandas / NumPy	Data cleaning, manipulation
Matplotlib / Seaborn	Data visualization
Jupyter Notebook	Development & EDA

# Key Objectives
Clean and preprocess review text data
Perform sentiment analysis on reviews
Identify rating trends across brands/products
Visualize word frequency (positive/negative reviews)
Explore relationship between ratings and recommendations

# Sample Insights
Most reviews with 5 star ratings use words like "great", "excellent", "value".
Negative reviews often include words like "bad", "poor", "disappointed".
Products with high sentiment scores are more likely to be recommended.
A noticeable gap exists between star ratings and actual review tone in some cases.

# Conclusion
This project helps businesses:
Detect product issues early using review feedback
Prioritize improvements for low-rated items
Use sentiment as an indicator of customer satisfaction beyond ratings
